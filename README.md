#Welcome to Rudi's Code Louisville C# project!
_______________________________________________


This is a console program that prompts the user to select an nfl week, then a game.
The program will then print the score to the console, and add the game to a list of games to be serialized into the games.json file.
The user can find more information about the game in the games.json file.

This program contains a cache of weekly schedules so the program doesn't download data that has already been requested by the user in the weekscache.json file.'

The data is fetched from sportradar.com, a comprehensive sports data API.

Enjoy!
