Welcome to Rudi's Code Louisville C# project!

This is a console program that prompts the user to select an nfl week, then a game.
The program will then print the score to the console, and add the score to a list of scores to be serialized into a .json file.
The data is fetched from sportradar.com, a comprehensive sports data API.

Enjoy!
